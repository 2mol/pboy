# TODO

- read a configuration file.
- initial setup screen when no config file exists.
- exception handling if `pdfinfo` or `pdftotext` are missing.
- inbox and library paths displayed on main screen.
- documentation.
- loading indicator when calling `pdftotext` takes a while.

## Maybe

- command-line options so that the application can be used without the UI
- build a search index based on the content we get from `pdftotext`.
