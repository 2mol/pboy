# PAPERBOY

![import screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2mol/pboy/master/doc/import.png)

Paperboy is a small .pdf management utility.

I was frustrated that most PDFs have pretty useless file names.

This tool helps renaming those files without too much fuss. It will rename/move documents to a specified folder, and it even gives some filename suggestions by looking at the file content and the pdf metadata.

Paperboy aims to keep its file management dumb (no keeping files in a database or hidden library folder), so you can uninstall it at any time and your files will remain perfectly accessible.

# Usage

- Open a new file import dialog with <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- Switch between the library and the inbox with <kbd>Tab</kbd>.
- Open a file from the library with <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>.
- Quit the application with <kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd>.

# Install

Make sure you have `poppler` installed, which will provide both `pdftotext` and `pdfinfo`. If you are using homebrew on Mac you can do `brew install poppler`. On Linux, install `poppler` with your package manager of choice.

For now you need stack to compile Paperboy (cabal probably works too):

```
git clone git@github.com/2mol/pboy.git
cd pboy
stack install
```

This will give you an executable named `pboy` in your local bin folder.

For nix users:
```
git clone github.com/2mol/pboy
cd pboy
nix-env -f . -i pboy
```

# Config

Paperboy creates a `.pboy.toml` in your home directory. Use this to change your library and incoming folders, as well as to specify whether you want to move the imported files or just copy them.

# Current Limitations

Consider this to be beta quality right now. Nothing in this tool will break your computer, but there is not a lot of exception handling for missing folders or missing utility programs.

For large files, `pdftotext` can take quite a long time to parse the document, which is stupid because we're only using the first couple of lines for file name suggestions.

[`brick` is lovely](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick/).

The name for this tool is inspired by [this atrocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboy_(video_game)), which I had for the NES and never quite mastered.
