# PAPERBOY

Born out of my frustration that

* Scientific papers generally have the most useless file names. What was `PFP_JFP06.pdf` or `1803.05316.pdf` again?
* My download folder is soup of those documents, as well as `omg_cute_snow_leopard.png`, `DXOpsCwX0AA3JXi.jpeg`, `David Lynch Teaches Typing.zip`, and about a hundred other files like that.
* I have zero desire manually crawl through every single pdf, open it to find out what's in it, think of a filename, rename it and move it to another folder.

Well, `paperboy` helps to rename those files without too much fuss. It will move files to a specified library folder, and it even gives some suggestions for the filename by looking at the file metadata and the content.

Paperboy aims to keep its file management dumb (no keeping files in a database or hidden library folder), so you can uninstall it at any time and your files will remain perfectly accessible.
