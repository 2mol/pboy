# PAPERBOY

Born out of my frustration that

* Scientific papers generally have the most useless file names. What was `PFP_JFP06.pdf` or `1803.05316.pdf` again?
* My download folder is dump of those documents, as well as `omg%20cutesnowleopard.png`, `DXOpsCwX0AA3JXi.jpeg`, `David\ Lynch Teaches\ Typing.zip`, and about a hundred other files like that.
* I have zero desire manually 1) crawl through that mess of a folder, 2) open the .pdfs to find out what's in them, 3) decide which ones I want to keep, 4) think of a filename, 5) rename it, and 6) move it to some precious library folder.

Well, `paperboy` helps to rename those files without too much fuss. It will rename/move files to a specified specified folder, and it even gives some suggestions for the filename by looking at the file metadata and the content.

Paperboy aims to keep its file management dumb (no keeping files in a database or hidden library folder), so you can uninstall it at any time and your files will remain perfectly accessible.
